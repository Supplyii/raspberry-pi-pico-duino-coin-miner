Step 1: Prepare the Raspberry Pi Pico

Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to your computer using a micro USB cable.
Ensure that the Pico is connected and recognized by your computer.
Step 2: Install MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico

Download the latest version of MicroPython for the Raspberry Pi Pico from the official website: https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico/
Follow the instructions provided by the MicroPython website to flash MicroPython onto your Raspberry Pi Pico.
Step 3: Install the urequests library

Download the urequests library file from the official MicroPython repository: https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/blob/master/urequests/urequests.py
Save the urequests.py file to a location on your computer.
Step 4: Copy the script to the Raspberry Pi Pico
Save the file with a meaningful name, such as duinocoin_mining.py.
Step 5: Copy urequests library to the Raspberry Pi Pico

Copy the urequests.py library file that you downloaded in Step 3 to the Raspberry Pi Pico.
Save the urequests.py file to the same location as your script file (duinocoin_mining.py) on the Raspberry Pi Pico.
Step 6: Run the script on the Raspberry Pi Pico

Safely eject the Raspberry Pi Pico from your computer.
Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to a power source.
The script will prompt you to enter your DuinoCoin username and password.
Enter your DuinoCoin username and password when prompted.
The script will start mining DuinoCoin using the provided credentials.

Make sure you have a stable internet connection while running the script, as it requires communication with the DuinoCoin API server to mine and retrieve account information.

I hope this helps you set up and run the DuinoCoin mining script on the Raspberry Pi Pico!
